\begin{frame}{Analysis of penguin morphological data}

Penguin dataset (Ksepka et al 2012) consisting of morphological data of:
\begin{itemize}
\item all extant penguins (19 species)
\item 36 fossil species assigned to stratigraphic intervals
\end{itemize}

\vskip2mm

Models:

\begin{itemize}
\item Lewis MK vs MKv (Lewis 2001)
\item Partitions vs single alignment
\item Rate variation across sites and across partitions
\item Tree prior: FBD and Skyline FBD
\item Different tree model parameterisations
\end{itemize}
