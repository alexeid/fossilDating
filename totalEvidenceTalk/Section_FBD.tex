\begin{frame}{The problem}

\begin{itemize}

\item We have 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \normalsize{{\bf molecular data} of extant species,} 
  \item \normalsize{{\bf morphological data} of extant and fossil species and }
  \item \normalsize{{\bf Fossil ages} (or geological time intervals).}
\end{itemize} 
\item We want to utilise all this data to learn about {\bf evolutionary history} and {\bf macroevolutionary processes}.
\item {\bf Bayesian statistical inference} is our preferred method of learning about the world.


\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Node dating}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Divergence time dating is tricky :) }
\item {\bf A common practice is node dating}. One or more divergences in a phylogeny are assigned ages by identifying fossils of known geological age that correspond* to each divergence. 
\item This method has a few drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Often only the oldest fossil in a calibrated clade is used,
\item Calibration densities are often {\it ad hoc},
\item Difficult* to combine calibrations with tree priors,
\item Computational complexity of some methods mean that only a few nodes can be calibrated (Heled \& Drummond 2012).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Tip dating and total evidence}

Two main features of new method for divergence-time dating:
\begin{itemize}
\item Explicit modelling of fossilization events as a part of the tree branching process (Pyron 2011, Heath {\it et al} 2014),
\item Utilising all existing data \textcolor{newblue1}{(total evidence)} in a joint inference (Pyron 2011, Ronquist {\it et al} 2012).
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%\begin{frame}{Total evidence}

%\begin{itemize}

%\item Pyron 2011 uses Lewis MK model to model evolution of morphological characters.  
%\item Ronquist et al 2012, Wood et al 2012. 
%\item They used Yule or Uniform tree prior. 
%\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Variation in the choice of the tree model parameters}

The $t_{or}$ parameter can be replaced with $t_{root}$ parameter assuming the process started with a branching event. 

\vskip2mm

Instead of $\lambda$, $\mu$, and $\psi$ we can also use an alternative parameterisation:

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}

\begin{equation*} 
\begin{tabular}{ll} 
\text{net diversification rate} & $d = \lambda-\mu$  \\ 
\text{turnover rate} & $\turnover = \frac \mu \lambda$ \\ 
\text{\sampleprop} & $\fosp = \frac\psi {\mu + \psi}$  \\ 
\end{tabular} \end{equation*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Heath {\it et al} approach and its extensions}

 Heath {\it et al} 2014 first used FBD model to infer divergence times of bears in a Bayesian MCMC framework:  

\begin{itemize}
\item The topology of extant species is fixed
\item Only used occurrence dates of fossils, and no morphology 
\item Fixed $\rho$ to the truth in the inference
\end{itemize}

We extend this model in two ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item Sampling sampled ancestor trees (Gavryushkina {\it et al} 2014)
\item Incorparating morphological data
\end{itemize}

Implemented in SA and Morph-models packages for BEAST2 (\url{www.beast2.org})
