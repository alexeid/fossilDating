@article{Gingerich1993,
	Abstract = {Calculation of evolutionary rates in phenotypic standard deviations per generation (haldanes) has several advantages over conventional calculation in factors of e per million years (darwins). Rates in haldanes are independent of dimension in a way that rates in darwins are not, making them more widely comparable, and rates in haldanes are more readily interpretable in terms of quantitative evolutionary genetics. Evolutionary rates are inversely related to time scale, and this must be considered when rates are compared. The slope of a log rate versus log interval [LRI] distribution is important for distinguishing significant directional change or stasis from a null expectation of random change, and the intercept of an LRI distribution provides an estimate of the average intrinsic generation-to-generation rate of an evolutionary time series. The intrinsic rate is important as the upper limit of possible long-term rates of evolution. Evolutionary lineages in the fossil record yield intrinsic rates similar to those observed in laboratory selection experiments and natural selection in the wild. Intrinsic rates for lineages in stasis lie within the range of rates for lineages undergoing directional change. Significant long-term stasis and evolutionary change do not differ intrinsically, which means change and stasis are determined by extrinsic environmental factors.},

@article{Gingerich1983,
	Abstract = {Rates of morphological evolution documented in laboratory selection experiments, historical colonization events, and the fossil record are inversely related to the interval of time over which they are measured. This inverse relationship is an artifact of comparing a narrow range of morphological variation over a wide range of time intervals, and it is also a product of time averaging. Rates measured over different intervals of time must be scaled against interval length before they can be compared.},

@article{Berger2015,
	Abstract = {Homo naledi is a previously-unknown species of extinct hominin discovered within the Dinaledi Chamber of the Rising Star cave system, Cradle of Humankind, South Africa. This species is characterized by body mass and stature similar to small-bodied human populations but a small endocranial volume similar to australopiths. Cranial morphology of H. naledi is unique, but most similar to early Homo species including Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. While primitive, the dentition is generally small and simple in occlusal morphology. H. naledi has humanlike manipulatory adaptations of the hand and wrist. It also exhibits a humanlike foot and lower limb. These humanlike aspects are contrasted in the postcrania with a more primitive or australopith-like trunk, shoulder, pelvis and proximal femur. Representing at least 15 individuals with most skeletal elements repeated multiple times, this is the largest assemblage of a single species of hominins yet discovered in Africa.},
