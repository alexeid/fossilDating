We demonstrate that a statistical "morphological clock" model of evolution can adequately describe the progression of morphological characters observed in the fossil record of two well-characterised datasets of vertebrate taxa: penguins and canids. The consistency of this model with geological data suggests a path to reconciliation of the sometime adversarial relationship between palaeontologists and molecular evolutionary biologists by a "total-evidence" approach to inferring evolutionary history under the rule of Bayesian probability.
